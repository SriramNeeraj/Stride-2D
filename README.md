Stride is basically the number of units that you move when you're moving your filter from one location to another. If stride is 1, then the filter will move to the right or down by 1 unit, but when it's 9, then it will move over by 9 units.Stride is a parameter of the neural network's filter that modifies the amount of movement over the image or video. For example, if a neural network's stride is set to 1, the filter will move one pixel, or unit, at a time.padding controls the amount of padding applied to the input. It can be either a string {'valid', 'same'} or a tuple of ints giving the amount of implicit padding applied on both sides. dilation controls the spacing between the kernel points; also known as the à trous algorithm.Stride: it defines the step size of the kernel when sliding through the image. Stride of 1 means that the kernel slides through the image pixel by pixel. Stride of 2 means that the kernel slides through image by moving 2 pixels per step (i.e., skipping 1 pixel).The filters are learned during training (i.e. during backpropagation). Hence, the individual values of the filters are often called the weights of CNN. A neuron is a filter whose weights are learned during training. E.g., a (3,3,3) filter (or neuron) has 27 units.filter or a kernel in a conv2D layer has a height and a width. They are generally smaller than the input image and so we move them across the whole image. The area where the filter is on the image is called the receptive field.The distance traveled during that motion is your stride length. In other words, your stride length is the distance from the toe of your right foot (starting position) to the toe of your right foot (ending position), or the heel of your right foot (starting position) to the heel of your right foot (ending position).17] experimentally compared facial ex- pression recognition performance using different filter sizes and found that the CNN with 5×5, 4×4, and 5×5 filter sizes in the three convolutional layer, respectively, has the best performance on 42×42 input images.During this learning process of CNN, you find different kernel sizes at different places in the code, then this question arises in one's mind that whether there is a specific way to choose such dimensions or sizes. So, the answer is no.There are couple of reasons padding is important: It's easier to design networks if we preserve the height and width and don't have to worry too much about tensor dimensions when going from one layer to another because dimensions will just "work". It allows us to design deeper networks.What is Padding in Machine Learning? Padding is a term relevant to convolutional neural networks as it refers to the amount of pixels added to an image when it is being processed by the kernel of a CNN. For example, if the padding in a CNN is set to zero, then every pixel value that is added will be of value zero.What is the effect of high Stride on the feature map? If Stride =1, then move the filter one pixel at a time. If Stride=2, then move the filter two-pixel at a time.When Deep Learning folks talk about “filters” what they're referring to is the learned weights of the convolutions. For example, a single 3x3 convolution is called a “filter” and that filter has a total of 10 weights (9 + 1 bias).The answer is you cannot analytically calculate the number of layers or the number of nodes to use per layer in an artificial neural network to address a specific real-world predictive modeling problem. The number of layers and the number of nodes in each layer are model hyperparameters that you must specify and learn.In photography filter size Refers to the inner diameter of the front of the lens, more specifically the threads into which a filter is screwed to attach it to the lens.A 2-D convolutional layer applies sliding convolutional filters to 2-D input. The layer convolves the input by moving the filters along the input vertically and horizontally and computing the dot product of the weights and the input, and then adding a bias term.

The dimensions that the layer convolves over depends on the layer input:

For 2-D image input (data with four dimensions corresponding to pixels in two spatial dimensions, the channels, and the observations), the layer convolves over the spatial dimensions.

For 2-D image sequence input (data with five dimensions corresponding to the pixels in two spatial dimensions, the channels, the observations, and the time steps), the layer convolves over the two spatial dimensions.

For 1-D image sequence input (data with four dimensions corresponding to the pixels in one spatial dimension, the channels, the observations, and the time steps), the layer convolves over the spatial and time dimensions.Therefore, an MLP that has an input layer, one hidden layer, and one output layer is a 2-layer MLP. The structure of an MLP can be summarized using a simple notation. This convenient notation summarizes both the number of layers and the number of nodes in each layer.Every network has a single input layer and a single output layer. The number of neurons in the input layer equals the number of input variables in the data being processed. The number of neurons in the output layer equals the number of outputs associated with each input.Usually, the filter size is printed along the edge of the filter's frame. Note that the size listed in bold on the frame of the filter is the filter's nominal size, which likely differs from its actual size.
